# Magic 8 Ball

This is a Magic Eight Ball Game I created, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Reason For Building

This was my first project where I implemented JavaScript, I made it to see what I learn from studying DOM manipulation.

# Project Challenges

This project had challenges I didnt fully overcome just yet for example, the circle in the middle of the eight ball is sometimes centered and sometimes not, 
I will fix as I progress of course, and the design was also tricky, updates will be coming.
