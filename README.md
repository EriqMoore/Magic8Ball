# Magic 8 Ball

This is a Magic Eight Ball Game I created, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Ask a question, your question will then be shown above the eight ball and the eight ball will give you an answer.

# Reason For Building

This was my first project where I implemented JavaScript, I made it to see what I learned from studying DOM manipulation.

# Project Challenges

This project had challenges I haven't fully overcame just yet for example, the circle in the middle of the eight ball on mobile is sometimes centered and sometimes not, 
so to make it easier and loyal to the look of a magic eight ball, I made it a triangle, and the design was also tricky, never the less it is still functional, updates will be coming.
